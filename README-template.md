## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
Starting to understand how flex layout works. Need more practice but im proud im learning codes that help center divs

```html
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
```css
section {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Continued development

Need more practice understanding page layout properties.
planning to get started on grid soon to see how i can use it to better my page layout skills.

### Useful resources

- [Layout with Flexbox](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-intermediate-css/modules/layout-with-flexbox/cheatsheet) - This helped me for understanding flexbox properties.
- [HTML elements references](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - This is an amazing page which helped me remember what elements to use. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning HTML.
